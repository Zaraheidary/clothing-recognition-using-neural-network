#clothing Detection using Neural Networks

#introduction 
this project implements a clothing detection system using a neural network trained on fasion images.
the goal is to accurately classify defferent types of clothing using deep learning techniques

##project overview
this project utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images of various clothing item.
the model was trained on the Fasion MNIST dataset, which consists of 60000 images of 10 different clothing categories.


##features
- **Deep Learning:** utilizes a cnn architecture for images classification.
- **Google Colab:**  code is implemented in google colab for easy access and usage.
- **High Accuracy:** the model achieves high accuracy in detecting and classifying clothing items.
